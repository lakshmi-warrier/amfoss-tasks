Even though I found way to get into Bandit quite easily, I couldn't proceed from Level 1 to 2 consecutively, or from Level 2 to 3, and so on, it kept on showing a Timeout Error. So, when I was done with a level, I'd close the terminal window and reopen it to get into the next level. 

``` ssh: connect to host bandit.labs.overthewire.org port 2220: Connection timed out ```


I thought that the site was broken. But it took me a month (by when, I'd already reached level 21) to figure out that I had to type ```exit``` to exit from each level.
