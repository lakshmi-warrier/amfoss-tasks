I didn't know I was supposed to write a Python code until I asked Athira Chechi. So spent quite a lot of time in figuring out a way to do that in Terminal Window. 
As soon as I knew it was Python, I wrote the code quite quickly. At first, I took data of only pinned repositories and then realised I had to get data from every repos. Took a whole day.

Also, I tried to do this task on Windows when Ubuntu didn't work. But failed utterly.
