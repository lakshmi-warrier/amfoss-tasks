# INTROSPECTION

## Why you should choose me
My empathy is really strong which obviously makes me a probem-solver - be it emotional or coding-related, I can pretty much easily predict possible errors a code(talking about small errors in school coding) or a human being can make which ultimately gives an edge in programming. For some reason, I've always had the _patience to  help the ones trying to learn_. (Exception: my younger sister - we usually end up fighting). __Give me a corner of a moderately silent room, with Wi-Fi and a charging port, I can sit there days coding enjoying my life__ :smirk: \
I genuinely wish you would choose me beacause I've always been so passionate about coding and amFOSS and the help put forward by the seniors is just unaccountable. So, I just can't wait to be a part of the team and if everything goes alright, be a senior and help the next Freshers :relieved: .
Another plus point is, __I can spend days surfing random stuffs__ and find tricks, tips and hacks for literally anything. 
And, I'm quite brave enough to experiment on stuffs to see if the outcome is similar to what I'd predicted - has led me to innumerable serious problems, though. Theoretical learning is way out of my league, which was a disadvantage for my whole school life. I need hands-on real-life application+experiment which I feel I'd get from amFOSS.\

## What I would be doing for next 6 months
__I'd be polishing my time management skills__\
By the end of next 6months, I'd be tasting whole 1st Sem of my college life and finding ways to adapt. So, I'd be knowing how school is different from college, learning atleast one new programming language(most probably, Rust or Go) and concreting my basics of the languages I already know. With curiousity as high as that of a cat, I'd be trying to complete the incomplete amFOSS tasks. But it highly depends upon the academic load. As of now the plan is and would always be to _go with the flow._

P.S: Even a mere plan for an hour goes down the drain. I'm more of a happy-go-lucky person. I clearly stick on to the common Malayalam phrase _"Varaanullathu vazhiyil thangilla"_ (Things that should happen, be it good or bad, will happen, no matter what)

## My contribution
I would surely work really hard and smart - coding wise, also importantly, I'd be a good teacher. Being able to think in different angles helps me teach people easily - pointing out the common possible misconcepts and also because I can never keep a new knowledge to myself. I can also make stuffs less complicated, again, be it programs or situations. And the main thing would be __I NEVER GIVE UP__. Once I get a work to be done, and once I begin it, there's no going back. That's one of the prime reasons why I've reached this far, writing a proud README showing off the number of tasks I've completed within 40 days(that might not be a big deal, but still... baby steps).

## Opinion on selection process

This selection process really sieves out apt and talented people out of a whole lot of students. It actually helps the students to know if they can cope up with academics and the club. In my opinion, I loved this approach. Unlike the school clubs where students join club to bunk class and get some special privileges, this process gives a trailer of what might happen later.Cannot lie, the lines from the task sheet like, ___You only have to learn the necessary things which are required to complete the task.___ and ___Please ask your questions in the discord channel whose link was sent along with the mail.___ was really motivating and inspiring. It kept me going.
