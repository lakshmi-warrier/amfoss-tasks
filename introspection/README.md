a. My WhatsApp chats with my classsmates (whom I've never met yet) proves that I can be quite a really good teacher. For some reason, I've always had a patience to  help the ones trying to learn if they genuinely want to learn. (The patience drains away only when I try to teach my younger sister - we usually end up fighting). My in-built empathy is really strong which obviously makes me a probem-solver - be it emotional or coding-related, I can pretty much easily predict possible errors a code or a human being can make. As part of the empathy, I can think of different ways to solve a problem effortlessly, which ultimately gives an edge in programming. Give me a corner of a moderately silent room, with Wi-Fi and a charging port, I can sit there days coding without complaining :) \
I wish you would choose me beacause I've always been so passionate about coding and amFOSS and the help put forward by the seniors is just unaccountable. So, I just can't wait to be a part of the team and if everything goes alright, be a senior and help the next Freshers XD.
Another plus point is, I can spend days surfing random stuffs and find tricks and tips for betterment of literally anything, especially text formatting in markdowns, like how I figured out <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd> Enter </kbd> or \ creates a newline and how to bring keyboard symbols on this markdown. 
And, I'm quite brave enough to experiment on stuffs to see if the outcome is similar to what I'd predicted - has led me to innumerable serious problems, though. Theoretical learning is way out of my league, which was a disadvantage for my whole school life. I need hands-on real-life application+experiment to store that info in brain permanently.

b. By the end of next 6months, I'd be tasting whole 1st Sem of my college life and finding ways to adapt into the lifestyle in hostel and living with friends. So, I'd be concentrating on how to be independent from teachers and family(once I reach hostel). I'd be learning more and more programming languages and concreting my basics of the languages I already know. Since I'm curious as a cat, I'd be trying to complete the incomplete amFOSS tasks. But it highly depends upon the assignments, homeworks and lectures that are to be completed. As of now the plan is and would always be to go with the flow.

P.S: I actually have no answer for this question. I'm more of a happy-go-lucky person. I clearly stick on to the common Malayalam phrase "Varaanullathu vazhiyil thangilla" (Things that should happen, will happen, no matter what)
